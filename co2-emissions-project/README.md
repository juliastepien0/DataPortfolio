# CO₂ Emissions Analysis – Top Emitters by Country
In this project, I analyzed the CO₂ emissions by country using the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data). The goal was to identify the top 10 emitting countries in the most recent available year and practice Pandas.

## Skills Practiced

- Reading and inspecting large CSV files with Pandas
- Filtering and slicing DataFrames using `loc`, `iloc`, and boolean masks
- Sorting and selecting top values
- Understanding the difference between Series and DataFrames
- Using `.info()`, `.head()`, `.to_string()` for exploration
- Creating a basic bar plot with Matplotlib

## What I Learned

- The importance of inspecting datasets before analysis
- How to slice and filter datasets efficiently
